Some people left Seekport this month and 2 of the remaining employees moved into the office I’m working in. That’s fine, and I’m leaving at the end of the week, but man I’m going crazy. This guy’s pounding on his keyboard like it’s a fucking whack-a-mole game! I don’t know what kind of keyboard he learned to type on but it must’ve been horrible. It sounds like he must go through at least 10 of those things in a year. I don’t know if I’ll make it until Friday without yelling "AGH! STOP THE MADNESS YOU CRAZY BASTARD YOU JUST HAVE TO TOUCH THE KEYS!"
