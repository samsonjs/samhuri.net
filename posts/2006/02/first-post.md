so it's 2am and i should be asleep, but instead i'm setting up a blog. i got a new desk last night and so today i finally got my apartment re-arranged and it's much better now. that's it for now... time to sleep.

(speaking of sleep, this new [sleeping bag](http://www.musuchouse.com/) design makes so much sense. awesome.)
