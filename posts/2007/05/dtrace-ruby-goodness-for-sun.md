Suddenly I feel the urge to try out Solaris for i386 again. Last time I gave it a shot was when it was first released, and all I ever got out of the CD was a white screen. It's been 2-3 years since then and it should be well-tested. I'll try to install it into a VM first using the ISO and potentially save myself a CD. (I don't even think I have blank CDs lying around anymore, only DVDs.)
