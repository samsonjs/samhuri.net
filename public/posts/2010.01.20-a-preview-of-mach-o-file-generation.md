<p>This month I got back into an x86 compiler I started last May. It lives <a
href="https://github.com/samsonjs/compiler">on github</a>.</p>

<p>The code is a bit of a mess but it mostly works. It generates Mach object
files that are linked with gcc to produce executable binaries.</p>

<p>The Big Refactoring of January 2010 has come to an end and the tests pass
again, even if printing is broken it prints <i>something</i>, and more
importantly compiles test/test_huge.code into something that works.</p>

<p>After print is fixed I can clean up the code before implementing anything
new. I wasn't sure if I'd get back into this or not and am pretty excited
about it. I'm learning a lot from this project.</p>

<p>If you are following the Mach-O posts you might want to look at
asm/machofile.rb, a library for creating Mach-O files. Using it is quite
straightforward, an example is in asm/binary.rb, in the #output method.</p>

<p>Definitely time for bed now!</p>
