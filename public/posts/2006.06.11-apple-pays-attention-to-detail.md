I think this has to be one of the big reasons why people who love their Mac, love their Mac (or other Apple product). I usually just have cheap PC speakers plugged into my Mac mini, but I didn't bring any with me to Munich and the internal Mac mini speaker isn't very loud, so I'm using headphones to watch movies. My Mac remembers the volume setting when the headphones ore plugged in, and when they're not, so I don't accidentally blow my ears. It's like my iPod pausing when the headphones are unplugged. It's excruciating attention to the smallest, (seemingly) most unimportant detail. I love it, and I'm hooked.
