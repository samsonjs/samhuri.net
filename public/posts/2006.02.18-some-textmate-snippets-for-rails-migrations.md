My arsenal of snippets and macros in TextMate is building as I read through the rails canon, <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/" title="Agile Web Development With Rails">Agile Web Development...</a> I'm only 150 pages in so I haven't had to add much so far because I started with the bundle found on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/TextMate">rails wiki</a>. The main ones so far are for migrations.

Initially I wrote a snippet for adding a table and one for dropping a table, but I don't want to write it twice every time! If I'm adding a table in **up** then I probably want to drop it in **down**.

What I did was create one snippet that writes both lines, then it's just a matter of cut & paste to get it in **down**. The drop_table line should be inserted in the correct method, but that doesn't seem possible. I hope I'm wrong!

Scope should be *source.ruby.rails* and the triggers I use are above the snippets.

mcdt: **M**igration **C**reate and **D**rop **T**able

    create_table "${1:table}" do |t|
        $0
    end
    ${2:drop_table "$1"}

mcc: **M**igration **C**reate **C**olumn

    t.column "${1:title}", :${2:string}

marc: **M**igration **A**dd and **R**emove **C**olumn

    add_column "${1:table}", "${2:column}", :${3:string}
    ${4:remove_column "$1", "$2"}

I realize this might not be for everyone, so here are my original 4 snippets that do the work of *marc* and *mcdt*.

mct: **M**igration **C**reate **T**able

    create_table "${1:table}" do |t|
        $0
    end

mdt: **M**igration **D**rop **T**able

    drop_table "${1:table}"

mac: **M**igration **A**dd **C**olumn

    add_column "${1:table}", "${2:column}", :${3:string}

mrc: **M**igration **R**remove **C**olumn

    remove_column "${1:table}", "${2:column}"

I'll be adding more snippets and macros. There should be a central place where the rails bundle can be improved and extended. Maybe there is...
