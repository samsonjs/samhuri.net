  The latest technology I've been learning is Palm's SDK for webOS,
  Mojo. My first impression is that it's a great platform and
  Palm could do a great job of 2.0 if they cut down on some of the
  verbosity of gluing together the UI. I have learned to like
  JavaScript over the years as I learned that despite its
  warts <a href="http://ca.video.yahoo.com/watch/630959/2974197">there
  are good parts</a> too. If you squint just right you can
  see that it's scheme with Algol syntax. HTML and CSS are what
  they are, but with WebKit running the show and only a single engine
  to target it's not that bad. I've gone from Eclipse to Emacs
  for the coding itself and highly recommend Emacs for Mojo
  development. There is nothing that I miss from the Eclipse or
  Komodo Edit thanks to the fact that Mojo uses open languages and
  standards.
</p>


<p>
  As far as actual development goes the Mojo documentation steers you
  towards a combination of Eclipse, Palm's Mojo plugin for Eclipse,
  and the Aptana Studio plugin. My editor of choice is Emacs but
  I decided to give it a spin just to get started quickly, how bad
  could it be? I'm not going to get into details but I will say that I
  don't think I'll ever use Eclipse for anything; it's far too
  sluggish and provides no compelling features for the languages
  that I use. I tried Komodo Edit and it was significantly
  better but still not for me. Emacs is great for editing HTML,
  JavaScript, and CSS so all I really missed from the IDEs were the
  shortcuts to package, install, and launch apps in the
  emulator. I headed over to
  the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a> and
  downloaded Jonathan
  Arkell's <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MojoSdk">Mojo
  support for Emacs</a> which provided a great base to get
  started with. There are wrappers around (all?) of the Palm SDK
  commands but it needed a bit of work to make it just do what I
  wanted with as little input and thought as possible.
</p>

<p>
  A couple of of Lisp hacking sessions later and I'm happy enough with
  mojo.el to bump the version to v0.9. I've checked off what I
  feel are the most important checkpoints on
  the <a href="http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Editors">webOS
  Internals comparison of editors</a> and the framework is in
  place to make implementing most of the remaining commands very
  trivial. I might take a bit of time today to flesh things out
  just to check more points off so people feel more confident that
  it's a fully featured environment, because it certainly is.
</p>


<p>
  It now requires json.el in order to parse appinfo.json. json.el
  might be included with Emacs if you have a very recent version,
  otherwise you can google for it or get it from
  my <a href="https://github.com/samsonjs/config/tree/master/emacs.d">config
  file repo on github</a> where you can also find my latest
  version of mojo.el. You still just (require 'mojo) in your
  .emacs file.
</p>

<p>
  The wrappers around Palm SDK commands now search upwards for the
  Mojo project root directory (from the default-directory for
  current-buffer) and parse appinfo.json to give you sane defaults for
  mojo-package, mojo-install, mojo-launch, mojo-delete, and
  mojo-inspect. You can list installed apps and when entering app
  ids there is completion and history, as you have come to expect in
  Emacs. The most useful command for development is
  mojo-package-install-and-inspect which does exactly what it says:
  packages, installs, and launches the application for
  inspection. No interaction is required as long as you are
  editing a buffer inside your Mojo project.
</p>


<p>
  If you read the install instructions in mojo.el and decide to setup
  some keybindings then you will have single-task commands for
  packaging, installing, launching, or all three steps at once.
</p>

<p>
  Please give me some feedback if you try this out. I've
  developed it on Mac OS X and Jonathan on Windows so please try it on
  Linux and send me a patch or even better a pull request on github if
  it needs some work. There is room for improvement.  The next feature
  on my radar before I would consider it worthy of a v1.0 tag is
  intelligent switching to corresponding buffers,
  e.g. mojo-switch-to-view, mojo-switch-to-assistant, things like
  that.  Basically things I miss from the Rails package for Emacs.
</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
