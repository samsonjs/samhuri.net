If you thought the PowerBook's two-finger scrolling was cool check out this touch screen:

> "While touch sensing is commonplace for single points of contact, multi-touch sensing enables a user to interact with a system with more than one finger at a time, as in chording and bi-manual operations. Such sensing devices are inherently also able to accommodate multiple users simultaneously, which is especially useful for larger interaction scenarios such as interactive walls and tabletops."

This is really amazing. Forget traditional tablet PCs... <i>this</i> is revolutionary and useful in so many applications. I hope this kind of technology is mainstream by 2015.
