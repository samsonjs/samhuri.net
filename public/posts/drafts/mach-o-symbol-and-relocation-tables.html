  This post is the last of a triplet on generating basic x86 Mach-O files
  with Ruby. The
  <a href="2010.01.17-working-with-c-style-structs-in-ruby">
   first post</a> introduced CStruct, a Ruby class used to serialize
  simple struct-like objects, while the
  second describes
  <a href="2010.01.18-basics-of-the-mach-o-file-format">the
   structure of a simple Mach-O file</a>.

<h2>Symbol Tables</h2>

<p></p>


<h3>N-List structures</h3>

<p></p>


<h3>Load Command</h3>

<p></p>


<h2>Relocation Tables</h2>

<p></p>


<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

As promised I'll show you how to create a very basic Mach-O binary
that you can execute on a machine running OS X (well, any x86 machine
running Darwin but at least 99% of the time that is OS X).
