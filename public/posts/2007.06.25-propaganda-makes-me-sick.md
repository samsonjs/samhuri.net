Things <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070625-spying-on-campus-fbi-warns-mit-harvard.html">like this</a> in modern times are surprising. Can't people spot this phony crap for what it is?

<tt>First they put away the dealers, keep our kids safe and off the streets<br>
Then they put away the prostitutes, keep married men cloistered at home<br>
Then they shooed away the bums, and they beat and bashed the queers<br>
Turned away asylum-seekers, fed us suspicions and fears<br>
We didn't raise our voice, we didn't make a fuss<br>
It´s funny there was no one left to notice, when they came for us<br>
<br>
<strong>Looks like witches are in season, you better fly your flag and be aware<br>
Of anyone who might fit the description, diversity is now our biggest fear<br>
Now with our conversations tapped, and our differences exposed<br>
How ya supposed to love your neighbour, with our minds and curtains 
closed?<br>
We used to worry 'bout big brother<br>
Now we got a big father and an even bigger mother</strong><br>
<br>
And still you believe, this aristocracy gives a fuck about you<br>
They put the mock in democracy, and you swallowed every hook<br>
The sad truth is, you'd rather follow the school into the net<br>
'Cause swimming alone at sea, is not the kind of freedom that you 
actually want<br>
So go back to your crib, and suck on a tit<br>
Bask in the warmth of your diaper, you're sitting in shit<br>
And piss, while sucking on a giant pacifier<br>
A country of adult infants, a legion of mental midgets<br>
A country of adult infants, a country of adult infants<br>
All regaining their unconsciousness<br>
