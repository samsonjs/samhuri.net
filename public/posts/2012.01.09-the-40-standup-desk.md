> Ultimately, I decided I might as well just do something cheap for now. So I built my own. I had thinking about doing it for a while when my coworker Steve Smith built his desk. After seeing his, I was convinced this was what I wanted to do. It turns out, the cheap option is pretty awesome.

This looks great. Might have to consider it when or if I get a desk.
