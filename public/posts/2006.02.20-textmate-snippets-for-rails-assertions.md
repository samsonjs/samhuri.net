This time I've got a few snippets for assertions. Using these to type up your tests quickly, and then hitting **⌘R** to run the tests without leaving TextMate, makes testing your Rails app that much more convenient. Just when you thought it was already too easy! (Don't forget that you can use **⌥⌘↓** to move between your code and the corresponding test case.)

This time I'm posting the .plist files to make it easier for you to add them to TextMate. All you need to do is copy these to **~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/Rails.tmbundle/Snippets**.

If anyone would rather I list them all here I can do that as well. Just leave a comment.

*(I wanted to include a droplet in the zip file that will copy the snippets to the right place, but my 3-hour attempt at writing the AppleScript to do so left me feeling quite bitter. Maybe I was just mistaken in thinking it would be easy to pick up AppleScript.)*
