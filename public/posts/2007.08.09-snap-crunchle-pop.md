I think that every now and then we need to be reminded of the frail nature of our human bodies.  Yesterday morning as I walked to my kitchen I was turning right by pivoting on my right foot when my 24 years of walking experience suddenly failed me.  I clearly did something wrong, as I heard a crunching pop or two in my right ankle and went down.  Luckily it's just a sprain but my foot is fairly bruised and still sore today.  I'm trying to follow the <a href="http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/sprainsstrains/a/sprain_4.htm">RICE</a> method for recuperating but one can only lay down for so long before having to eat, work, use the bathroom, etc.  Thank goodness I don't work on my feet or I'd be out of commission.  If it still hurts next week I'm going to see a doctor but till then I'm trying not to leave my house.  The idea of hopping and hobbling to a bus to go to a doctor does not thrill me in the slightest.

Oh, if you find yourself in a bind an upside down hockey stick is a decent makeshift crutch.  You'll need 2 hands to operate the thing though.

At the opposite end of the spectrum there are times when we seem to be amazingly resilient creatures.  Check out a documentary called *"101 Things Removed from the Human Head"* if you can find it anywhere.  One of those things was a boat anchor, I kid you not.
