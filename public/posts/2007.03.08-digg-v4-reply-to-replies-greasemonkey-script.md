It's nearly identical to <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4664">the previous one</a> but works with Digg v4 and should be slightly more efficient. I'm working on making it faster because I believe it is quite inefficient as it is. It was David Bendit's (the original author) first script though so kudos to him for starting this thing because I love it. I just hate a slow greasemonkey script on pages with hundreds of comments.

Please leave me some comments if you appreciate this, or have any feedback on the code.

Happy Digging!
