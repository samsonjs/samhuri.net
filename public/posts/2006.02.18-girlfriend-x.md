This is hilarious! Someone wrote software that manages a "parallel" dating style.

> In addition to storing each woman's contact information and picture, the Girlfriend profiles include a Score Card where you track her sexual preferences, her menstrual cycles and how she styles her pubic hair.

It's called [Girlfriend X](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70231-0.html), but that's a link to an article about it. I didn't go to the actual website. I just thing it's amusing someone went through the trouble to do this. Maybe there's a demand for it. *\*shrug\**
