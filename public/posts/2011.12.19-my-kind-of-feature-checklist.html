Marco's feature checklist in favour of the iPad illustrates how easy it is
to rig these things. Combined with Amazon's checklist favouring the Kindle
Fire this would be mildly useful, half as long as a modest review, and with
more or less the same conclusions.

Seriously though some of the items on Marco's list are pretty important to
most people but would never make anyone's feature checklist. Goes to show
that most feature checklists are bullshit.
