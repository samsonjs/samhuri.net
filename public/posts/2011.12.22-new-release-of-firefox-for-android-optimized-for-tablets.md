> On the other hand, watch this video. Even in Mozilla's own demo - which presumably puts Firefox for Android in its best light - doesn't the whole thing look a bit herky-jerky, in terms of touch responsiveness and scrolling smoothness?

Surely they could do better on iOS though. I have faith in the Firefox
team to provide a good experience because they have done so in the
past. Modern versions of Firefox are excellent.
