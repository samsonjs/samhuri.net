Last weekend I moved out of the apartment I lived in for the last 3 1/2 years. Moving was a cinch thanks to a friend's garage, conveniently placed smack between my old place and the new one. Google maps tells me that I moved just under 3.4 km, which is 2.1 mi for the metric impaired, so it wasn't much of a move at all! My roommate and I live in the basement of a house split into 3 apartments. Our upstairs neighbours are friendly and seem pretty cool, except one lady upstairs seems a bit strange. It's a great place though and in the winter the wood stove fireplace is going to be awesome.
