I lived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria%2C_British_Columbia">Victoria</a> for over a year before I ever rode the <a href="http://www.bcferries.com/">ferry</a> between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Island">Vancouver Island</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsawwassen">Tsawwassen</a> (ignoring the time I was in BC with my family about 16 years ago, that is). I always just flew in and out of Victoria directly. The ferry is awesome and the view is incredible, navigating through all those little islands. Last time I rode the ferry I snapped this shot. It's possibly the best picture I've taken on that trip.
