So long since my last post, and all I'm going to do is complain. ;-)  Seriously though, if you have a website and the content on said site is dated then please – for the love of our almighty saviour, the <a href="http://www.venganza.org/about">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> – <em>put the date at the <strong>top</strong> of the page</em>.  Don't make me scroll down to the end of the article just to see how relevant it is or just to give me some context. Not to mention that I always end up doing a "Where <em>is</em> the end? Oh crap, I passed it and now I'm in the comments, blargh!"

I'm looking at Lifehacker since they're the most recent offender I've come across, but they are definitely not the only ones guilty of this.
