I've realized that OS X really does obey Fitt's law in all 4 corners now. Apple menu in the top left, Spotlight top right, and the bottom 2 are always accessible for drag n drop, unless the dock is hidden. I rarely ever use it because I usually have pretty good chunks of the desktop showing, but it is useful.
