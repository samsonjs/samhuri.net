# About me

I'm Sami Samhuri, a software developer and general technology geek. Sometimes
I write my thoughts and post my projects here. I moved to [Victoria, BC][vic]
in 2003 to study computer science at the [University of Victoria][uvic], and
drop out a couple of years later.

## What I do

I spend a lot of time writing web apps with Ruby and JavaScript, and less time
making things for iOS and Android. I dabble with lots of other technologies for
fun and profit and have been known to do some ops and devops.

My public work includes [some open-source projects][proj], and there are even
more on [GitHub][] but you'll have to wade through ones that I've forked from
others.

You can learn more about my career on [Zerply][]. Which I can barely write
with a straight face. *Zerply?*

## So meta

This site is lovingly hand-crafted, tag by tag and pixel by pixel. It adheres to
and embraces modern web standards. It is authored in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
in conjunction with [Markdown][Markdown] and [LESS][], and then it's all
compiled with [harp][] before [Apache][] serves it up. The header and body font,
[Museo Sans][Museo], is provided by [TypeKit][].

Oh, and a shout out to [Font Awesome][fa] for being awesome.
