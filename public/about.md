Title: About me
Page type: profile

I'm Sami Samhuri, a software developer and general technology geek. Sometimes I write my thoughts and post my projects here. I moved to [Victoria, BC][vic] in 2003 to study computer science at the [University of Victoria][uvic], and then dropped out a couple of years later.

## What I do

I make iOS apps, and I make web apps from front to back mainly with Ruby and JavaScript. Sometimes I do some Android work and have a strong preference for Kotlin. I dabble with lots of other technologies for fun and profit and have been known to do some ops and devops. I've been using Linux for over 20 years, and have spent a bit of time with FreeBSD and OpenBSD along the way.

My public work includes [some open-source projects][proj], and there are even more on [GitHub][] but you'll have to wade through ones that I've forked from others. At some point or other I've written: [C][], [Objective-C][objc], [Swift][], [Java][], Python, [Ruby][], [bash and zsh][sh], [Haskell][], [Lisp][], Scheme, PHP, [Objective-J][objj], [Motorola 6800][m6800] assembly, and of course the language everyone loves to hate, the ever [maligned][pusher] [yet][repl-edit] [omnipresent][format] [JavaScript][strftime] ([which][nw] [I][kwikemon] [kind][deferred] [of][gitter] [like][batteries] [most][deferredviz] [of][elisp] [the][mojoext] [time][node]).

## So meta

This site is lovingly hand-crafted, tag by tag, and pixel by pixel. It adheres to and embraces modern web standards. It is authored in [Markdown][], HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then it's all compiled with [some custom code][samhuri.net] before [Caddy][] serves it up.

Oh, and a shout out to [Font Awesome][fa] for being awesome. <svg class="icon icon-thumbs-up" viewBox="0 0 512 512" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" style="color: #ccc"><path transform="translate(0,448) scale(1,-1)" d="M104 224c13.2549 0 24 -10.7451 24 -24v-240c0 -13.2549 -10.7451 -24 -24 -24h-80c-13.2549 0 -24 10.7451 -24 24v240c0 13.2549 10.7451 24 24 24h80zM64 -24c13.2549 0 24 10.7451 24 24s-10.7451 24 -24 24s-24 -10.7451 -24 -24s10.7451 -24 24 -24zM384 366.548 c0 -42.416 -25.9697 -66.208 -33.2773 -94.5479h101.724c33.3965 0 59.3965 -27.7461 59.5527 -58.0977c0.0839844 -17.9385 -7.5459 -37.249 -19.4395 -49.1973l-0.109375 -0.110352c9.83594 -23.3369 8.23633 -56.0371 -9.30859 -79.4688 c8.68164 -25.8945 -0.0683594 -57.7041 -16.3818 -74.7568c4.29785 -17.5977 2.24414 -32.5752 -6.14746 -44.6318c-20.4102 -29.3242 -70.9961 -29.7373 -113.773 -29.7373l-2.84473 0.000976562c-48.2871 0.0166016 -87.8057 17.5977 -119.561 31.7246 c-15.957 7.09961 -36.8203 15.8877 -52.6504 16.1787c-6.54004 0.120117 -11.7832 5.45703 -11.7832 11.998v213.77c0 3.2002 1.28223 6.27148 3.55762 8.52148c39.6143 39.1436 56.6484 80.5869 89.1172 113.11c14.8037 14.832 20.1885 37.2363 25.3936 58.9023 c4.44629 18.501 13.749 57.7939 33.9316 57.7939c24 0 72 -8 72 -81.4521z"/></svg>
